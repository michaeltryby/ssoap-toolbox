===========
The Sanitary Sewer Overflow Analysis and Planning (SSOAP) Toolbox was developed jointly by the U.S. EPA and CDM Smith Inc. to help engineers in analyzing the behavior of rainfall derived infiltration and inflow (RDII).  Concepts of the SSOAP Toolbox have been tested on different projects, and are currently used successfully to perform simulations and help solving engineering problems.  Although a reasonable effort has been made to assure that the results obtained are correct, good engineering judgment is essential for checking and using the results of this program.  Neither U.S. EPA nor CDM Smith are responsible and assume no liability whatsoever for any results or any use made of the results obtained from the SSOAP Toolbox nor for any damages or litigation that result from the use of the SSOAP Toolbox for any purpose.
